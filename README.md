# Advent of Code 2020 Solutions

[https://adventofcode.com/2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

I decided to use this as an opportunity to learn and practice Rust after
hearing that my friend Peter was doing so, so I'm using Rust for these problems
even though I don't really know the language yet. So, just know that if you
stumble across these solutions they might be bad examples of Rust code. :)

Each day has two parts, and I may or may not create different directories for
each part's solution, so check the commit history for the state of the solution
for part 1.
